# Colours

This documentation specifies the colour usage on the Clan Quest website. Exceptions should be explicitly agreed upon by the web administrators.

## Primary colour

The primary colour for the Clan Quest website is #ECD689. This is also the main colour used in the Clan Quest logo. The colour should be used for accentuation on the website. Uses include but are not limited to:

* Header text
* Indication an "on" state for a toggle

Primary colour should never be used for large bodies of text.

In case a darker version of the primary colour is needed, #B48249 can be used. For a lighter variant, use #FFFFBA.

## Secondary colour

The secondary colour for the Clan Quest website is #4D90B7. This colour is reserved for interactable components. This creates a consistent expectation of what can be interacted with and what can't.

All links on the Clan Quest website should use #4D90B7. The one exception for this are the links to not-yet-created pages on the wiki, the so-called red links. These get the colour #F99D9D to be in line with the convention of red links on other wikis, but the colour is adapted to not stand out too much from the Clan Quest palette.

## Foreground and background

The Clan Quest website favours a dark theme with lighter text, as this is a more familiar theme for the gamer community, which is the audience of the Clan Quest website. We avoid hard blacks where possible.

The main page body has an RGB value of 40 for each colour (#282828). On larger screens, the page body is often surrounded by a darker background to distinguish the empty space. This empty space has an RGB value of 10 for each colour (#101010). #101010 can also be used as boxes on top of the main body to draw attention.

Note that the above colour value should only be used for background elements. For elements that sit on top of the page layout (e.g. the navbar or modals), the colours should be replaced by a hard black with an opacity of 80%.

Main bodies of text are displayed in full white to maximize the contrast and readability of the text.

## Remaining brand colours

The two other colours associated with the Clan Quest brand are #304785 and #60381A. These are currently not used in the Clan Quest layout, as they represent darker colours that do not fit on the generally dark themed Clan Quest website.

## TODO

* Link hover state
* More info on foreground/background in general (more hover states here too)
* More shades of each colour (maybe show a colour palette?)
* Do buttons get primary colour or secondary?
* Messaging colours: green, amber, and red for success, warning, and error respectively
