	<p>Clan Quest is a clan representing every nationality that plays video games. 
	All of us are united by our love of quests and lore. We complete every quest, 
	examine every piece of lore, and love doing it. We invite anyone, from novice 
	to expert, to join our community.</p>

	<h2>20+ Countries</h2>

	<p>Whether you’re in the prairies of Western Canada, the Dutch countryside, the 
	south island of New Zealand or anywhere in between you’ll always find someone 
	online to share your gaming session with.</p>

	<h2>Our Guilds</h2>

	<p>Since 2009 the &quot;Quest Noobs&quot; of Clan Quest have been a dominant 
	force within the game of RuneScape. The Quest Noobs are frequently recognized by 
	Jagex, including members' content appearing in game and having multiple JMods join 
	our community (both officially and unofficially). Clan Quest unites those people 
	who are passionate about RuneScape's lore and who love engaging with a 
	community that holds each other up.</p>

	<p>We take our relationship to our clan members very seriously. We believe strongly that real 
	life commitments are more important than commitment to the clan. Any member is allowed to 
	join any event or any communication channel we provide. With this we don’t have any 
	activity requirements to retain membership.</p>

	<p>A relatively new addition to Clan Quest's organization, the Old School RuneScape guild 
	is comprised of many players who originally discovered our community through its involvement 
	in RuneScape 3. With time, the guild has developed as its own entity, and its membership is unique 
	and growing. If you have a love for the more retro of Jagex's MMOs, check out the OSRS Guild!</p>

	<p>Clan Questers spend a lot of hours playing video games together and chatting on our 
	forums and <a href="https://discord.gg/ejWecQP">Discord server</a>. As such some have even elected to meet other Clan Questers in real life!</p>

	<p>Whether it’s a small meetup in Atlanta or attending RuneFest, Clan Quest has regular meetups. 
	Meetups are of course not mandatory but they are a joy to attend. Friendships made in Clan Quest true 
	and authentic and have potential to expand to the real world if you desire.</p>

	<p>Clan Quest has also attended RuneFest in force. For consecutive years Clan Quest 
	has had 15 or more clan members attending from all over the world! Going to 
	RuneFest? We’ll see you there!!!</p>
