	<p>Clan Quest is an online community, originally created for players who enjoy 
	the lore and quests of RuneScape, and has since branched out with members in 
	over 30 countries. It organizes its members into <a href="https://clanquest.org/wiki/Guilds" target="_blank">Guilds</a>, centered around different 
	games and interests, that comprise <a href="https://clanquest.org/wiki/Clan_Quest" target="_blank">Clan Quest</a> as a whole. Clan Quest members 
	enjoy questing and lore, providing help with difficult aspects of games, 
	and making terrible puns.</p>

		<p>Since 2009, the "Quest Noobs" of Clan Quest have played RuneScape. Its members are 
			recognized by Jagex, appreciate the uniqueness of RuneScape, have had content added 
			to the game, and have had multiple Jagex employees in our community. Clan Quest unites 
			people who are passionate about RuneScape and the game's quests and lore.</p>

		<p>The Old School RuneScape (OSRS) Guild is composed of players who prefer RuneScape's 2007 style charm. 
		This Guild is for those questers who enjoy Dragon Slayer 2, Monkey Madness 2, 
		and all the quests again in a 2007 style package. If you like the “original version” of RuneScape 
		check out the OSRS Guild, where its members are almost as opinionated as awesome.</p>

		<p>Beyond the realms of RuneScape, Clan Quest offers a hub for chess players of all levels. Whether you're a seasoned club 
			player or a curious beginner, join us for friendly tournaments and discussions about all things chess. Come sharpen 
			your skills and connect with fellow chess enthusiasts!</p>

	<p>While Clan Questers obviously play video games together and use our forums and <a href="https://discord.clanquest.org" target="_blank">Discord server</a> to 
	communicate, real life meetups have become one of our community’s coolest activities. Whether it’s a small meetup in Atlanta, attending a game convention like RuneFest, or 
	larger gatherings like the clan’s own Quest Fest, meetups extend our community to the real world. With our 
	continued growth, we have hosted meetings on four continents, and continue to aspire to be 
	a leader in the online community.</p>
