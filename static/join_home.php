	<p>Clan Quest is an online community, originally created for players who enjoy 
	the lore and quests of RuneScape, and has since branched out with members in 
	over 30 countries. It organizes its members into <a href="https://clanquest.org/wiki/Guilds" target="_blank">Guilds</a>, centered around different 
	games and interests, that comprise <a href="https://clanquest.org/wiki/Clan_Quest" target="_blank">Clan Quest</a> as a whole. Clan Quest members 
	enjoy questing and lore, providing help with difficult aspects of games, 
	and making terrible puns.</p>

	<h2>RuneScape</h2>
	<p>Since 2009 the "Quest Noobs" of Clan Quest have played RuneScape. Its members 
	are frequently recognized by Jagex, have had many pieces of suggested content added 
	in game and have had multiple Jagex employees in our community. Clan Quest unites 
	people who are passionate about RuneScape, its lore, and writing the guides others read.</p>

	<h2>Old School RuneScape</h2>
	<p>The Old School RuneScape (OSRS) Guild is composed of players who prefer a more classic 
	Runescape experience. This Guild is for those questers who enjoy Dragon Slayer 2, Monkey Madness 2, 
	and all the quests again in a 2007 style package. If you like the “original version” of RuneScape 
	check out the OSRS Guild, where its members are almost as opinionated as awesome.</p>

	<p>Members of our Rocket League Guild love playing soccer with their cars. Clan Quest isn’t all 
	about lore, we love our fast paced games too! They play both casual and competitive and are always 
	looking for new members. All we are going to say is, “GGOOOOAAAALLLLLL!!!”</p>

	<p>Like Clan Quest? Like RuneScape? Are you an Ironman? Then the RuneScape 3 Ironman Guild is 
	for you. The Guild is tailored specifically for players who play the Ironman mode including group 
	PvM and Questing.</p>

	<h2>Our Meetups</h2>

	<p>While Clan Questers obviously play video games together, and use our forums and <a href="https://discord.clanquest.org" target="_blank">Discord server</a> to 
	communicate, real life meetups have become one of our community’s coolest activities. With our 
	continued growth, we have hosted meetings on four continents, and continue to aspire to be 
	a leader in the online community.</p>

	<p>Whether it’s a small meetup in Atlanta, attending a game convention like RuneFest, or 
	larger gatherings like the clan’s own Quest Fest, meetups have become regular occurrences. 
	Friends from online are becoming friends in person, and while not mandatory, many of us 
	have found meetups are a joy to attend. Friendships made in Clan Quest can expand to the real world if you desire.</p>
